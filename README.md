# NullMove

This is a chess model, which I trained from scratch, using the Alpha Zero architecture.

It is a huge work in progress, and requires (an estimated 50 days of training to get somewhat ok)

I have made a previous model before, but it is in a private repo, as it was an academic project.

I am planning to make it downloadable and playable locally/webhosted.

This was obviously assisted with by LLM's (like ChatGPT) for the architecture and the training and datapipeline!!!
